- Yahallo, I’m @NihilisticArrow, and in real life Ankkriss
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and mastering a single coding language rather than diversifying too much and end up learning everything half baked.
     Currently, I'd say that im trying to get proficient in Java and its applications such as web and app development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as i said prior, the nitty gritty of java as i'm confident on my core java skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing so far since im not sure what i can add value but im looking to learn new skills if possible
- 📫 How to reach me ...
